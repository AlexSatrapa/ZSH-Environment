README
======

This collection of code is an esoteric and whimsical set of ZSH scripts to set up my environment the way I like it, across Mac OS X and Linux.

It is by no means complete. Please feel free to contribute your changes.

INSTALLING
==========

To get started:
 - clone from github: git clone git://github.com/AlexSatrapa/ZSH-Environment.git ~/.zsh.d
 - symlink ~/.zsh.d/zshrc to ~/.zshrc
 - in .zsh.d, symlink all the scripts you want to have active to files with names of the form SXX_Blah where XX is some number 00-99.
 - source ~/.zshrc
